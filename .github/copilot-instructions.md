1. Brief Background of the Project

Our project, SeniorCare, is a web application designed to make everyday social and personal tasks easier for senior citizens. As people age, managing finances, daily essentials, health routines, and social engagement can become challenging due to mobility issues, forgetfulness, or lack of digital literacy. SeniorCare provides a simple, user-friendly interface that helps seniors manage key aspects of their daily lives — all in one place.
The app includes:

Wallet Tracker – to help users monitor and manage their expenses.

Grocery Store – for easy ordering of essentials online.

Community Events Section – to promote social interaction and allow users to enroll in local events or activities.

Medicine Reminder – to ensure timely intake of prescribed medications.


By integrating these modules, SeniorCare aims to promote independence, improve quality of life, and foster a sense of community among elderly users.

2. Motivation Behind Choosing the Problem

The motivation behind developing SeniorCare stems from the growing need to support the aging population through accessible technology. Many senior citizens face difficulties in performing routine tasks such as shopping, managing finances, or remembering medications.
While there are separate apps for these needs, most are either too complex or lack inclusivity for older users. Our goal is to create an all-in-one, easy-to-navigate, and senior-friendly platform that simplifies daily life, encourages digital participation, and enhances emotional well-being by keeping users connected to their community.
Additionally, as engineers, we wanted to apply our technical knowledge to solve a socially relevant problem that can have a real impact.

3. Importance of Data Structures in Solving This Problem

Data structures play a crucial role in making SeniorCare efficient, organized, and reliable. Some key applications include:

Arrays and Lists: To store user data such as reminders, event registrations, or grocery items in an ordered manner.

Stacks and Queues: For managing task scheduling, notifications, and order processing in the grocery module.

Hash Maps (Dictionaries): To enable quick retrieval of user profiles, product details, and reminders based on keys like user ID or medicine name.

Trees and Graphs: Useful for organizing community event data (e.g., by category or location) and suggesting nearby activities.

Databases and Linked Structures: For maintaining relationships between users, transactions, and activities efficiently.


Efficient use of data structures ensures faster access, better organization, and smoother performance, especially when handling multiple users and large datasets simultaneously.
