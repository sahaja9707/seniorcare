# Medicine Page Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. **Converted Python Logic to TypeScript**

Created the following files:

- `src/lib/dataStructures/MedicineQueue.ts` - Priority Queue (Min-Heap) implementation
- `src/lib/medicine.ts` - Medicine validation and utility functions

**Key Features:**

- Priority Queue data structure for medicine reminders (sorted by next reminder time)
- Min-heap implementation for O(log n) insertions and deletions
- Automatic calculation of next reminder times
- Expiry date validation

### 2. **Integrated with Firebase**

Uses Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations:

- Read/write to Firestore `users/{userId}/medicines` collection
- Secure server-side validation

### 3. **Created API Endpoints**

Created the following API routes:

- `src/app/api/medicine/route.ts` - Main CRUD operations
  - GET: Fetch all medicines for a user
  - POST: Add new medicine
  - PUT: Update existing medicine
  - DELETE: Delete medicine
- `src/app/api/medicine/reminders/route.ts` - Priority Queue operations
  - GET: Get next reminder and upcoming reminders (sorted by priority)

### 4. **Connected Frontend Components**

- `src/lib/hooks/useMedicine.ts` - Custom React hook for medicine operations
- `src/app/medicine/page.tsx` - Full-featured medicine management page

**Frontend Features:**

- Display all medicines sorted by next reminder time (Priority Queue)
- Show next upcoming reminder at the top
- Add new medicine with multiple reminder times
- Delete medicines
- Real-time updates
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive UI matching your design system

## üìä Data Structure: Priority Queue (Min-Heap)

### Why Priority Queue?

- Medicines need to be reminded in chronological order (earliest first)
- O(log n) insertion and deletion complexity
- O(1) peek for next reminder
- Efficient for scheduling and reminder systems

### How it works:

1. When medicines are loaded, all reminder times are calculated
2. Each medicine-time pair is inserted into the priority queue
3. The queue automatically sorts by earliest reminder time
4. Frontend displays medicines in priority order
5. Next reminder is always at the top (peek operation)

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Step 1: Start your dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Medicine Page

- Login to your app
- Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Medicine

### Step 3: Add a Medicine

- Click "Add Medicine +"
- Fill in:
  - Name: e.g., "Aspirin"
  - Dosage: e.g., "500mg"
  - Frequency: e.g., "2x daily"
  - Times: e.g., "09:00", "21:00"
  - Expiry (optional): e.g., "2025-12-31"
- Click "Add"

### Step 4: View Priority Queue in Action

- Medicines are sorted by next reminder time
- Next reminder shows at the top with countdown
- Multiple reminder times create multiple entries in the queue

### Step 5: Delete a Medicine

- Click "X" button on any medicine card
- Confirm deletion
- Medicine and all its reminders are removed

## üîß API Endpoints Usage

### Get all medicines

```typescript
GET /api/medicine?userId={userId}
Response: { success: true, medicines: [...], count: number }
```

### Add medicine

```typescript
POST /api/medicine
Body: {
  userId: string,
  name: string,
  dosage: string,
  frequency: string,
  times: string[], // ["09:00", "21:00"]
  expiryDate?: string
}
Response: { success: true, medicineId: string, medicine: {...} }
```

### Delete medicine

```typescript
DELETE /api/medicine?userId={userId}&medicineId={medicineId}
Response: { success: true, message: string, medicineId: string }
```

### Get next reminders (Priority Queue)

```typescript
GET /api/medicine/reminders?userId={userId}&limit=10
Response: {
  success: true,
  nextReminder: {...},
  upcomingReminders: [...],
  totalMedicines: number,
  totalReminders: number
}
```

## üéØ Data Structure Implementation Details

### Priority Queue Operations:

- **enqueue(reminder)**: Add reminder, bubble up (O(log n))
- **dequeue()**: Remove top reminder, bubble down (O(log n))
- **peek()**: View next reminder without removing (O(1))
- **getAllSorted()**: Get all reminders sorted by time (O(n log n))
- **clear()**: Clear all reminders (O(1))

### Medicine Model:

```typescript
interface Medicine {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  dosage: string;
  frequency: string;
  times: string[]; // HH:MM format
  nextReminderTime?: Date;
  expiryDate?: string;
}
```

### Reminder Model:

```typescript
interface MedicineReminder {
  nextReminderTime: Date;
  medicineName: string;
  dosage: string;
  medicineId: string;
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Notifications**: Add browser/push notifications for reminders
2. **History**: Track when medicines were taken
3. **Snooze**: Allow users to snooze reminders
4. **Recurring**: Auto-generate next day's reminders
5. **Analytics**: Show medicine adherence statistics
6. **Search/Filter**: Filter medicines by name, frequency, etc.
